        <h2>Why Marcus Aurelius Matters</h2>
        <p>Marcus Aurelius isn’t just a historical figure—he’s a guide for modern life. As a Roman Emperor, he ruled with humility and courage. As a philosopher, his writings in <em>Meditations</em> offer profound reflections on resilience, leadership, and personal growth. His life embodies the Stoic principle: you can’t control external events, but you can always control how you respond to them.</p>
