        <h2>About the Creator</h2>
        <p><i class="fa fa-bold" aria-hidden="true">:My name is Arpan Adhikari. I came to know about stoicism while wandering in search of mental clarity.</i></p>
        <p> •	Facing Adversity: Life was tough. I felt overwhelmed by challenges and emotions, unsure of how to handle everything that was happening.</p>
        <p> •	The Encounter with Stoicism: During this difficult period, I stumbled upon Marcus Aurelius. His thoughts on accepting what’s beyond our control and focusing on how we respond to things felt like a lifeline.</p>
        
       <p> •	The Fundamental Shift: Stoicism taught me to stop stressing over things I couldn’t change. Instead, I began focusing on what I could control—my reactions, thoughts, and actions.</p>
        
      <p> •	A New Way of Thinking: Challenges stopped feeling like setbacks. I started seeing them as opportunities to learn, grow, and become stronger.</p>
                                                           
      <p>  •	Emotional Mastery: I realized I didn’t have to be driven by every emotion that came my way. Stoicism helped me take a step back, think before reacting, and approach situations more calmly.</p>
        
      <p> •	Cultivating Resilience: Life’s difficulties didn’t disappear, but I became more resilient. Stoicism gave me the clarity and strength to face them without feeling completely lost.</p>
        
      <p> •	Embracing Growth: Over time, stoicism shaped how I viewed personal growth. It helped me become more grounded, focused, and intentional with my decisions and actions.</p>
